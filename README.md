# MyDiscordBot - Meo

A Discord bot using [Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) created in my free time to learn and have fun.^^

### Update 09/4/2022
- No spare time available *sigh*, guess I'll send this repo straight to the archive.

### Update 27/06/2021

- Streaming music doesn't work anymore. It worked last time I checked, and I haven't touched the audio part ever since. I'll try to figure out the reason behind this, and fix it in my spare time.

## What it does

- Trivial commands, i.e. `say hi`, `send messages`, `react to messages`, ...
- *[Not working]* Stream music (one server/one channel at a time and only songs from *[songs.json](https://github.com/SxweetLollipop/MyFirstDiscordBot/blob/master/2nd/songs.json)* - my songs in my laptop :3).
- Execute commands relevant to *[Codeforces.com](http://codeforces.com):*
    - Listing all incoming contests.
    - Showing information of a user, including `rank`, `rating`, `maxRating`, `lastOnlineTime`, given the handle.
- *[Beta]* Host games:
    - Games: `Chess` (unfinished), `3x3 Sliding Puzzle` (rather slow).
    - With save feature.
    - Can host each game one match at a time in all servers.
- And some commands created for my own needs :3.
- Many commands require a `config.json` to function. Since there are private infos, mine isn't uploaded. In case of need, consider creating your own.
